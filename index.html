            <h2>
                Maine coon
            </h2>           
        <p>
            There are many reasons to get a cat of the maine coon breed, the most important being its <b>size</b>. 
            Maine coon cats are the biggest domesticated cats today. They are also recommended to beginner owners, so
            there is no need to worry if a person is capable of caring for it. They come in many different colours, are friendly,
            and seem like the perfect cat breed. However, there is one problem, the maine coon cat breed is not
            a usual cat breed you can get in the Czech republic :( <br> Of course you 
            can find a place to get them, but they cost a lot of money. For example, <a href="https://zvirata.bazos.cz/inzerat/190519226/mainska-myvali-kotatka-s-pp.php"><i><b>these</b></i></a>
            maine coon kittens cost 20 000 czech crowns each. You cannot even find them in animal shelters, 
            unless they are old and ill. Although adoption is a great thing to do, I do not have the money to care for 
            an ill cat, that has special needs and only a few months left to live.

            <h2>
                Bengal - silver
            </h2>
        <p>
            Bengal cats are known for their <b>exotic fur pattern</b>. The most known kind of bengal cats is the beige coloured one.
            I like the silver coloured kind more. They are also very energetic and playful, you can even train them to be 
            comfortable with a harness on and go on walks with them. Once again the only way to get them in Czech republic is to buy
            them, although this time they are a bit cheaper. <a href="https://zvirata.bazos.cz/inzerat/190204886/bengalska-kotata.php"><i><b>These</b></i></a>
            two silver bengal kittens are being sold for 8 500 czech crowns each.

            Typical czech stray

        <p>
            Then there is the typical czech stray cat. It is gray, fluffy, and most importantly, <b>free</b>!

        <h2>
            Sphynx - black
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sphynx are a very unique breed of cat. They have no fur and are hypo-allergenic because of it.
