        <p>
            There are many reasons to get a cat of the maine coon breed, the most important being its <b>size</b>. 
            Maine coon cats are the biggest domesticated cats today. They are also recommended to beginner owners, so
            there is no need to worry if a person is capable of caring for it. They come in many different colours, are friendly,
            and seem like the perfect cat breed. <b>However,</b> there is one problem, the maine coon cat breed is not
            a usual cat breed you can get in the Czech republic :( <br></br> Of course you 
            can find a place to get them, but they cost a lot of money. For example, <a href="https://zvirata.bazos.cz/inzerat/190519226/mainska-myvali-kotatka-s-pp.php"><i>these</i></a>
            maine coon kittens cost 20 000 czech crowns each. You cannot even find them in animal shelters, 
            unless they are old and ill. Although adoption is a great thing to do, I do not have the money to care for 
            an ill cat, that has special needs and only a few months left to live.

                Bengal - silver
            </h2></li>  
        <p>
            Bengal cats are known for their exotic fur pattern. The most known kind of bengal cats is the beige coloured one.
            I like the silver coloured kind more. They are also very energetic and playful, you can even train them to be 
            comfortable with a harness on and go on walks with them. Once again the only way to get them in Czech republic is to buy
            them, although this time they are a bit cheaper. <a href="https://zvirata.bazos.cz/inzerat/190204886/bengalska-kotata.php"><i>These</i></a>
            two silver bengal kittens are being sold for 8 500 czech crowns each.
