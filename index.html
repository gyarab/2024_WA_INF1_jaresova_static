            Cat breeds I will get one day and why

        <h2>
            Maine coon
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are many reasons to get a cat of the maine coon breed, the most important being its <b>size</b>.
            Maine coon cats are the biggest domesticated cats today. They are also recommended to beginner owners, so
            there is no need to worry if a person is capable of caring for it. They come in many different colours, are
            friendly,
            and seem like the perfect cat breed. However, there is one problem, the maine coon cat breed is not
            a usual cat breed you can get in the Czech republic :( <br><br /> Of course you
            can find a place to get them, but they cost a lot of money. For example, <a
                href="https://zvirata.bazos.cz/inzerat/190519226/mainska-myvali-kotatka-s-pp.php"><i><b>these</b></i></a>
            maine coon kittens cost 20 000 czech crowns each. You cannot even find them in animal shelters,
            unless they are old and ill. Although adoption is a great thing to do, I do not have the money to care for
            an ill cat, that has special needs and only a few months left to live. :/

        <h2>
            Bengal - silver
        </h2>
        <p>
            Bengal cats are known for their <b>exotic fur pattern</b>. The most known kind of bengal cats is the beige
            coloured one.
            I like the silver coloured kind more. They are also very energetic and playful, you can even train them to
            be
            comfortable with a harness on and go on walks with them. Once again the only way to get them in Czech
            republic is to buy
            them, although this time they are a bit cheaper. <a

            two silver bengal kittens are being sold for 8 500 czech crowns each.

        <h2>
            Munchkin
        </h2>
        <p>
            Munchkin cats are the cat equivalent of weiner dogs. They have really <b>short legs</b> compared to the rest
            of their body, They are very Small, frail, and cute.
            Sometimes they have health problems tied to their leg length. There is a big problem which is that it is
            almost impossible to find a place to buy or adopt a
            munchkin cat in. I could not find a single listing.

        <h2>
            Typical czech stray
        </h2>
        <p>
            Then there is the typical czech stray cat. It is gray, fluffy, and most importantly, <b>free</b>! Stray cats
            have longer life spans and are less
            likely to have a chronical illness. They are the purrfect base cat.

        <h2>
            Sphynx - black
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sphynx are a very unique breed of cat. They have no fur and are <b>hypo-allergenic</b> because of it. There
            are beige ones and black ones.
            I like the black sphynx cats better, because the beige ones look like raw chicken. Because of their special
            fur, they are once again very pricy.

            little kitten is worth 15 000 czech crowns.
